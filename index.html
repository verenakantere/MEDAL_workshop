<p>The field of data analytics includes techniques, algorithms and tools for the inspection of data collections in order to extract patterns, generalizations and other useful information. Big data analytics has become a necessity in the majority of industries, enabling engineers, domain experts and scientists alike to tap the potential of vast amounts of data that are critical for business and science. The success and effectiveness of such analysis depend on numerous challenges related to the data itself, the nature of the analytics tasks, as well as the computing environment over which the analysis is performed. 
These issues have given rise to many diverse programming models, execution engines and data stores to enable large-scale data management. While all these systems have had great success, they still showcase their advantages on a limited subset of applications and types of data: For instance, graph-processing engines limit the amount of freedom in the computation at each node (or part of a graph) and fail to fully exploit possible parallelism.
In addition, modern analytics workflows are tremendously complex: Data sources are heterogeneous and distributed. The tasks may be long- or short-running and entail different execution details depending on the user role and expertise. Furthermore, such tasks may range from simple or complex data operations and queries, to algorithmic processing, like data mining, text retrieval, data annotation, etc. Finally, the analysis may require multiple query engines. 
<em>To harvest the benefits of this plethora of data and compute engines as well as programming models, libraries and tools available, we need coordinated, adaptive and integrative efforts on collectively tapping their potential.</em> This central goal is the focus of this workshop. These efforts include the definition of versatile programming models, engine performance modeling and monitoring, extended planning and optimization algorithms, deployment/execution on multiple engines, as well as workflow management and visualization techniques, for complex analytics queries over large, heterogeneous, irregular or unstructured data over diverse compute environments.</p>

<a id="workshop-focus-and-related-topics" class="anchor" href="#workshop-focus-and-related-topics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workshop focus and related topics</h3>

<p>The goal of the 1st International Workshop on Multi Engine Data Analytics (MEDAL) is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to explore, discuss and possibly redefine the state of the art in big data analytics relative to modeling, methods and tools applied over any part of algorithms and computing infrastructures, as well as use-cases and applications that relate to big data analytics over multi-engine environments. 
Concretely, the workshop is expected to provide insight into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modeling of analytics processes: new models and languages to program, represent and execute complex tasks</li>
<li>Execution of analytics processes: planning, optimizing and executing complex or multiple workflows especially on dynamic multi-engine and elastic environments</li>
<li>Tools for advanced analytics tasks: theoretical and practical development of analytics tasks and operators for regular and irregular computations</li>
<li>Visualization of analytics tasks: adaptive, user-friendly and diverse representation of real-time and batch tasks executing over single or multiple runtimes</li>
<li>Applications of big data analytics: case-studies, exhibition of application-specific challenges<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This workshop will solicit original research work on fundamental aspects of big data analytics as well as the design, implementation and evaluation of novel tools, methods and applications for optimizing big data workflows (in parts or as a whole). We note here that contributions may span a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to):  </p>

<ul>
<li>New or advanced models for data analytics, especially those unifying multiple data and execution engines</li>
<li>Languages for data analytics</li>
<li>Data analytics on multi-engine environments, adaptive execution</li>
<li>Execution semantics of data analytics </li>
<li>Analytics engine runtime monitoring </li>
<li>Unified cost models towards multi-engine analytics optimization</li>
<li>Multi-workflow optimization </li>
<li>Visualization tools or UI architectures that integrate multiple analytics inputs</li>
<li>Scheduling algorithms and tools for analytics execution</li>
<li>Applications and use cases of data analytics over diverse platforms</li>
<li>Visionary ideas on data analytics</li>
</ul>

<a id="submissions" class="anchor" href="#submissions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submissions</h3>

<p>MEDAL will be a half-day event, organized and themed around the ASAP FP7 EU-funded project (<a href="http://www.asap-fp7.eu/">http://www.asap-fp7.eu/</a>), which tackles the problem of complex analytical tasks over multi-engine environments that require integrated profiling, modeling, planning and scheduling functions.
Papers will be submitted as PDF files, using the ACM SIG Proceedings double-column template (<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates</a>) with a page limit of:
8 pages for full submissions
4 pages for short/visionary paper submissions
2 pages for demo/tutorial submissions </p>
